    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


    DOWNLOAD_URL = 'https://uk.wuaki.tv/'

    def downloadPage(url):
        data = requests.get(url).content
        return data

    def analyze_html(htmlString):
        # create the html object with BeautifulSoup
        soup = BeautifulSoup(htmlString, 'html.parser')
        # find all movie info
        movieListSoup = soup.find_all('li', attrs={'class' : 'movie'})
        # get the move name and output it
        for movieLi in movieListSoup:
            movieName = movieLi.find('span').string
            print(movieName)
            print(DOWNLOAD_URL + movieLi.find('a')['href'])
        # get more movies based on the link
        moreMovieLinkList = soup.find_all('a', attrs={'class' : ['more', 'next']})
        for moreMoiveLink in moreMovieLinkList:
            analyze_html(downloadPage(DOWNLOAD_URL + moreMoiveLink['href']))

    def main():
        analyze_html(downloadPage(DOWNLOAD_URL))

    main()
